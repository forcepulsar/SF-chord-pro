[Intro]

[Verse 1]
       C                                              Em
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
      Am           G     F
I'll sail the world to find you
       C                                                  Em
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
      Am         G     F
I'll be the light to guide you
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Dm                          Em
   Find out what we're made of
     F                                     G
When we are called to help our friends in need
 
[Chorus]
        C                Em
You can count on me like one, two, three
      Am       G
I'll be there
    F
And I know when I need it
      C                 Em
I can count on you like four, three, two
           Am       G
And you'll be there
     F
'cos that's what friends are s'posed to do
   C
Oh yeah
                  Em
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...

If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
       Am       G   F
I'll sing a song beside you
           C                                        Em
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
       Am       G   F
Every day I will remind you, oh
